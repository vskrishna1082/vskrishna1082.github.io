Hi, and welcome to my webpage! I am Krishna, a final year Master's student at [IISER Pune](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/), working in Statistical and Biology-adjacent physics disciplines. If you'd like to have a look at the videos of some of my simulations, they are in an archive of my [previous webpage](/demo/) until I figure this HTML business out.

Currently, I'm a visiting Master's student in the [Theoretical Biophysics Working Group](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/527801.html) at the University of Göttingen, looking into the viscoelastic properties of Cytoskeletal elements.

I like cats; in fact, there is one hiding in this website—try finding it[^1]! I also enjoy books and animated movies. Computers pique my interest.
